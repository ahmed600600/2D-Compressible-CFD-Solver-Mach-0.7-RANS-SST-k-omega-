# 2D-Compressible-CFD-Solver-Mach-0.7-RANS-SST-k-omega-
Built a complete 2D compressible RANS solver in Python for simulating airflow over a circular cylinder at Mach 0.7 with the SST k-omega turbulence model. The solver uses a structured O-grid mesh, AUSM+ flux splitting, and explicit 3-stage Runge-Kutta time integration.
